This project was done during the intro days, team of 5people trying out mob programmering for the first time.
Task: create a page with the following, a header with responsive image/video, one form and one accordion. The form should be set to post the data.
Accordion done with javascript.

## The problem

We started making a sketch of 3 different views in figma. After that we set up the mob programming, one driver and four navigators. First day we switch 
after 5min, but the second day we decided to go for 10min each. We ran into problem with the picture tag, so we decided to go for background-image for the header and use different sizes of the image for each view. I learned from this that mob programming is a very fun and good way to share knowledge.
If we had more time, we could look into additional styling for the different element in the form.
